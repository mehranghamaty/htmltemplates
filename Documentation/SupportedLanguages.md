We are going to use the following library to perform our translations:

https://github.com/OValery16/Language-Translation-with-deep-learning-

This assuming the host language being English. 

In order to specify a different language during a request use:

```
...
pages.set_language('EN');
...
```

To see my fork, check [here](https://github.com/mehranghamaty/Language-Translation-with-deep-learning-). 

Basically made things work more simply out of the box.
